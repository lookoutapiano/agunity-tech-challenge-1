# AgUnity Tech Challenge 1

Register for an API key at https://openweathermap.org/and wait for your key to
become active.
Create an interface in pure HTML, CSS and TS (no frameworks except Redux,
Chrome compatible browser with latest ECMAScript features) that takes a
location as input and a button to query the above api and displays relevant
information in a clean design. Include a README to explain how to test your code.
This should take no more than 1-2 hours.
Send us a link to a your github repo with the code.
